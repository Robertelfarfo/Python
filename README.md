### Practice with the heritage in Python

In this projects I show little examples on how to use python classes. The first code I create some figures classes and in the second I created a user interface for show simple calculations. 

#### Practicing the heritage in Python 

In the lines of figures.py I create a class call "Figure". The daugther classes I called them "square", "circle" and "right-triangle". It is a very simple code but I understood how the heritage works in Python

Is important to test the code that is developed. Python has some modules for this task as nose.
