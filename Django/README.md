# Django

Django is one of the Framework more popular for the backend and has a predefined user authentication, I mean, each time a new user is created is necessary to choose a username and an email, for authentificate an user is necesary to type the username.

Usually any site autentifite their users with the email and the password, in the folowing project I show how to do that.
